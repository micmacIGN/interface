Prerequisites

    Micmac's graphic interface requires Qt 4.8 with the OpenGL module to run properly.
    
    On Ubuntu type : sudo apt-get libqt4-opengl
    
    You can also get a copy of Qt runtime libraries and development files at :
        http://qt-project.org/downloads
    
    If you use Windows precompiled binaries, get Qt libraries for Visual Studio 2010.
    
    On Linux and Mac OS will will also need tiff2rgba utility included into "libtiff-tools" package.
    
    On Ubuntu, type : sudo apt-get libtiff-tools

Compile from sources

    Prerequisites
    
        On Ubuntu type : sudo apt-get libqt4-opengl-dev
        This will install Qt development files needed for the creation of Micmac's graphic interface.
        Archives download from qt-project.org already contains those development files.

    Get GUI source code

        Micmac's Mercurial repository also contains the source code for the graphic interface, so if you cloned
it, you can skip this step.

        Otherwise, you will need two archive files :
            - core Micmac source code file (micmac_source_revXXX.tar.gz)
            - GUI source code file (micmac_interface_source_revYYY.tar.gz)
        Extract files from the archives in the same directory :
            - tar xf micmac_source_revXXX.tar.gz
            - tar xf interface_micmac_source_revYYY.tar.gz
        The second tarball will add two "interface" directories, one in micmac's root directory containing runtime needed
files and one in micmac/src with the source code.
    
    Compilation

        Compilation process is the same as for the core program compilation except you will need to pass the argument
            -DWITH_INTERFACE=1
        on the cmake step. A typical usage will be :
            cd micmac
            mkdir build
            cd build
            cmake ../ -DWITH_INTERFACE=1
            make install -j
        If everything went well, your micmac/bin directory will contain two more binaries :
            - interfaceMicmac
            - test_ISA0
